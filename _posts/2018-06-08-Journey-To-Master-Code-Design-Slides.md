Today I did the opening keynote for the second day of [I T.A.K.E. Unconference 2018](https://itakeunconf.com). It's about how other designers learn and become better designers, and what we can take from them.

Please see the slides here: [https://www.slideshare.net/alexboly/the-journey-to-master-code-design](https://www.slideshare.net/alexboly/the-journey-to-master-code-design). I will update this blog post when the videos are published.

As always, let me know what you think through twitter.
