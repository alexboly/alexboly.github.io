I am Alex BolboacÄƒ, the code designer. I have almost 20 years professional experience in software development, training, coaching, and consultancy. I came to the conclusion that software design is a core practice, and that we can learn a lot from other design disciplines.

I've been exploring this topic through a book on applying UX principles to improve the developer experience with the code, and through many talks.


### This is an open invitation

I invite everyone interested in the topic to contribute to this blog. My dream is to build a community that learns together about these topics, and to find more people with whom to exchange ideas about design.
